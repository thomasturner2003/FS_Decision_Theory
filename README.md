# FS Points Change
Calculates the expected points change during Formula Student events through simulated changes to event time using FSUK 2025 results. It is relevant to EV's which are in the performance pack excluding outliers (listed in red). To convert for IC efficiency should be considered. For projections outside the performance pack (ie outliers that do not fit the trend) it will not be accurate as there is a non-linear relationship. The quality of the linear fit is high but can always have inaccuracies and up to date data should always be used as the cars become faster and more likely to compete.
